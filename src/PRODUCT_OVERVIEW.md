# Sound Credit Union AI Financial Co-Pilot

## The Problem

Credit union members are constantly missing out on perks and rewards. They have credit cards and accounts loaded with rewards, cashback offers, and benefits, but they're using the wrong card at the wrong time. Buying groceries with a 1% card when they have a 5% cashback card in their wallet. Paying fees that could be waived with a different account tier. Losing travel credits, subscription perks, and merchant-specific offers.

**The Core Issues:**

1. **Mental Overhead**: Tracking which card to use where requires constant mental overhead that users don't want to navigate. Members default to one convenient card and lose hundreds, even thousands, of dollars annually.

2. **Zero Visibility**: Most members have no insight into their own spending patterns or optimization opportunities. They don't know which credit card would actually serve them better, how much they're spending in different categories, or what benefits they're entitled to but never using.

3. **Perk Blindness**: Valuable perks go completely unused because people don't know they exist (Visa Signature concierge, hotel portfolios, early paycheck access) or can't access them when needed. Benefits are buried in 50-page PDF agreements that no one reads.

4. **Lost Wealth**: These aren't just missed rewards—they represent real wealth that could be compounding over time. By the time members review monthly statements, the opportunity to optimize is long gone.

## The Solution

**A real-time financial co-pilot that integrates directly with bank accounts via Plaid API to analyze every transaction as it happens, delivering instant SMS alerts at the point of purchase, automatic savings capture, and intelligent wealth building.**

### Pitch
AI financial assistant that connects to your bank accounts to optimize every purchase, recover lost value in real-time, and automatically grow your savings in a high-yield account using intelligent spending insights.
